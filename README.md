# SizeSpectrumGame
The code used for the master thesis: A game in the size spectrum

The code is not well commented, but the files named Tmp_.. should demonstrate how I computed the results

files named Plt_[NUMBER] are the files that generated the figures of the report, where [NUMBER] is the figure number(s), some of these scripts load data that is not included in this repossitory.
